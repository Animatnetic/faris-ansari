        "Description": "This was my first serious attempt at making a game. Black Ridge is a fictional research facility that contains anomalous entities inspired by the Half-Life series. As the technical lead, this was my first look into designing extensive systems, such as gun mechanics, virtual trains, doors, and the anomalous entities themselves, which can be controlled. This was the first project that had me work in a team, which taught me the importance of maintainable, modular code.",
